# üñºÔ∏è Cifar10 Image Recognition

The 'Cifar10 Image Recognition' project is capable of recognizing images from the CIFAR-10 database. Developed for a machine learning course at Tampere University, the main goal was to create a system using Python, Keras, and TensorFlow that can accurately recognize images in a reasonable time.

## üåü Key Features

- **Semi-Good Accuracy:** Achieves respectable accuracy in image recognition.
- **Decent Speed:** Processes images quickly.
- **Minimal Training Data Required:** Performs well without needing a large amount of data.
- **Ease of Fine-Tuning:** The system can be easily adjusted and improved.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language for the project.
- **Keras and TensorFlow:** Utilized for building the image classification model.
- **Database Manipulation Tools:** Employed to handle and manage large datasets.

**Extra Info:** This project was a fun challenge, particularly in fine-tuning the classifier to enhance its performance.
