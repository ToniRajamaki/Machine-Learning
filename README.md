# üñºÔ∏è Cifar10 Image Recognition

Welcome to my **Cifar10 Image Recognition** project! This project is capable of recognizing images from the CIFAR-10 database. It was developed as part of a machine learning course at Tampere University. The primary goal was to build a system using Python, Keras, and TensorFlow that can accurately recognize images in a reasonable amount of time.

## üåê Project Overview

The **Cifar10 Image Recognition** project focuses on building an image classification model capable of recognizing images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. This project emphasizes achieving respectable accuracy, decent speed, and ease of model fine-tuning.
