# üñºÔ∏è Cifar10 Image Recognition

The 'Cifar10 Image Recognition' project is capable of recognizing images from the CIFAR-10 database. Developed for a machine learning course at Tampere University, the main goal was to create a system using Python, Keras, and TensorFlow that can accurately recognize images in a reasonable time.
